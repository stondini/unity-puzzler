<h1>Introduction</h1>
Puzzler is a project of Udacity VR Developer nano-degree (term 2).
The Players has to solve a pattern based puzzle like Simon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)).
This write up presents the project achievement process that starts with Persona description, scene sketches & ideas, sound & light environment, user testing and deployment on a device. This entire process was executed iteratively (agile methodology).

Goals of this write up :
* Game description, ideas and scenarii to be sure the audience will understand all the concepts (sketches and screenshots of a beta version help to materialise).
* First tests feedback. They are useful to improve the game iteratively.
* What are the next amazing steps likely to interest the audience.

<h2>Save the Princess</h2>
The player must reproduce the orbs sequence to open the drawbridge and save its lovely Princess.






<h1>Scene</h1>
Even I like “Save the Princess” scene but I will implement the “default” Puzzler scene using the starter project assets (I’m not a designer so it’s hard to draw all scene elements in 3D).
To improve the “reality” sensation or mood, here few possible improvements :
Flame effect / particle in all torches (with different colours if possible).
Add a Joker or King’s Fool in the center of the scene. Its hat balls could represent our orbs. Not implemented because of lack of graphic designer.
Add a dark night sky.

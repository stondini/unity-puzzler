<h1>Introduction</h1>
Puzzler is a project of Udacity VR Developer nano-degree (term 2).
The Players has to solve a pattern based puzzle like Simon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)).
This write up presents the project achievement process that starts with Persona description, scene sketches & ideas, sound & light environment, user testing and deployment on a device. This entire process was executed iteratively (agile methodology).

Goals of this write up :
* Game description, ideas and scenarii to be sure the audience will understand all the concepts (sketches and screenshots of a beta version help to materialise).
* First tests feedback. They are useful to improve the game iteratively.
* What are the next amazing steps likely to interest the audience.

<h1>Sketches</h1>
<h2>Enter to Paradise</h2>

The player must reproduce the orbs sequence to enter to Paradise.

<h2>Traffic Jam</h2>

The player must reproduce the orbs sequence to stop the traffic and cross the road.

<h2>Save the Princess</h2>

The player must reproduce the orbs sequence to open the drawbridge and save its lovely Princess.

<h1>Scene</h1>

Even I like “Save the Princess” scene idea, I will implement the “default” Puzzler scene using the starter project assets (I’m not a designer so it’s hard to draw all scene elements in 3D).

To improve the “reality” sensation or mood, here few possible improvements :
* Flame effect / particle in all torches (with different colours if possible).
* Add a Joker or King’s Fool in the center of the scene. Its hat balls could represent our orbs. Not implemented because of lack of graphic designer.
* Add a dark night sky.

<h2>Testing the Scene</h2>

The first light environment test wasn’t a success.
The tester didn’t like the orb’s size (too big) and the violet spot light.
He liked the real torch fire effect.

The tester liked it. Smaller orbs and the blue spot light matches the “light” of the orbs.

<h1>Graphical User Interface</h1>
<h2>Start UI</h2>

* Introduce the player experience
* Tell the player what to expect
* Begin the puzzle

<he>Restart UI</h2>

* Tell the player if he/she has succeeded
* Give the player to play the game again

_Fig.3 : First UI_

![GUI-2|690x303](upload://1WXoxcTwUPER6Clu4J08K9gSxaU.jpeg)
_Fig.4 : Second UI_

I chose the text of First UI sketch because it explains what to do/how to play. 
And I chose the buttons of the second UI sketch because I liked the idea of a dungeon door.  (_Buttons of the first UI look like a standard application_).

<h1> GUI - User Testing </h1>

  <tr>
    <td>Do you see some panels in front of you ?</td>
    <td>Yes giant panels ! Good explanations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What do you think these panels are for ?</td>
    <td>They are dedicated to start and restart the game. They look floating.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Do you guess how to start the game ? </td>
    <td>Yes, I suppose I have to click on the door.</td>
  </tr>

<h2> Movement - User Testing </h2>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you feel about the speed of this first movement (too slow, too fast) ?</td>
    <td>It was fine. I had time to see the entrance and progressively discover inside.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did you feel sick or uncomfortable ?</td>
    <td>No. But a wahoo sensation. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did you notice any sort of height changes or anything disorienting in the movement ? </td>
    <td>No, but during the exit movement, I went through the left orb.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Audio and Visual Feedback - User Testing</h2>

  <tr>
    <td>Did you like the audio and visual feedback ?</td>
    <td>Yes, the night, the starry sky and the ambient sounds are consistent.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h1>User Testing Results</h1>
Hereafter the changes I made according to the testing phases :

* Reducing the orb’s size (too big)
* Changing the orbs spot light colour from violet to blue.
* The tester helped me to chose the and combine the UI panels (text and icons).
* Changing the global ambient colour to have a more darker and night mood.

<h1>Breakdown of final project</h1>

<h1>Next Steps</h1>
I consider this version of the game as a beta version. The game logic works.

But in terms of scene, I’m not satisfied.
The final game should present several scenes the user could chose at the beginning of the game. To develop those additional scenes, I need a designer and a sound maker. Each scene has its own mood.

<h1> Conclusion</h1>
The Puzzler VR game was interesting in terms of iterative design and enjoying in terms of implementation.

As a developer, I would have liked to write a little more code. 
Fortunately, the use of iTween and the audio source capabilities have been great discoveries.

There is a big difference between the initial idea and the final realization because I did not have enough time and neither the graphic designer skills.
